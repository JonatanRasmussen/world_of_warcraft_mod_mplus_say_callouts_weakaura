### Website (import link)

Like most other World of Warcraft Weakauras, my mod is hosted on **[this Wago.io page](https://wago.io/6CDe7U7t6)**.

### Showcase

This clip on YouTube shows the WeakAura's chat bubble functionality:

*(Click to open on YouTube)*

If you are unfamiliar with World of Warcraft, this is what I want you to pay attention to:
Notice how my character at 0:02 says Swirls and at 0:11 my character says Traps.
These warnings happen 1-2 seconds before the harmful swirlie effects on the ground, which is obviously helpful.

### Features

It uses the WeakAura framework to automatically scan the combat_event_log for dangerous events. For each of spell id configurations, it then creates a chat bubbles above your head when dangerous events and casts happen, warning you and your party members about important enemy abilities in Mythic+ dungeons.

Other Weakaura packs do a similar thing. However, I believe my package is pupular due to the increased focus on user experience. My weakaura creates chat bubbles instead of icons or sound alerts, and it is only triggered on the most dangerous abilities (I manually configure this for each dungeon). Also, each message is very short (only 1 or 2 words) and they are wrapped with raid markers, like this:
{cross} Dodge {cross}, {skull} Totem {skull}. These raid markers are displayed as a Skull or a Red X in-game, making them easy to parse visually in the middle of combat.
